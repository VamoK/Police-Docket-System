<h1>Police Docket System</h1>
<h2>Project Background</h2>
<p>The Police Docket System originated as an idea from a group of first-year students. The goal was to develop a reliable backup system for police departments, enabling them to capture and store docket information securely in a database. The system is structured into three main components:</p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Login/Sign-Up</b>
    <p>Officers are required to sign up, and their details are stored in the database. Access is restricted to registered users only, ensuring unauthorized personnel cannot interact with the system.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Storing Dockets</b>
    <p>Registered users can securely store docket information. All data is saved directly into the database for efficient record-keeping and future access.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Retrieving Dockets</b>
    <p>Only administrators have the authority to retrieve dockets. This restriction enhances data security and simplifies monitoring access to sensitive information.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Java(Core, EJB, JPA, JPQL, JSP)</li>
  <li>Derby Database</li>
  <li>GlassFish(server)</li>
</ol>
